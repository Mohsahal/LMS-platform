# Quiz Delete Feature & Security Warning Fix

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Security Warning for 404 Errors
**File:** `server/middleware/security-middleware.js`

**Issue:** The security middleware was logging all 404 errors as "suspicious activity", causing unnecessary warnings when users accessed non-existent routes like `/auth`.

**Solution:** Updated the `securityLoggerMiddleware` to exclude 404 errors from suspicious activity logging. Now only actual server errors (500+) and slow requests are flagged.

**Code Change:**
- Added check for 404 status codes
- Modified condition to only log 500+ errors or slow requests (excluding 404s)

### 2. Added Quiz Delete Functionality
**Files Modified:**
- `server/controllers/instructor-controller/quiz-controller.js`
- `server/routes/instructor-routes/quiz-routes.js`

**Feature:** Instructors can now delete quizzes they created.

**Security:**
- ✅ Only the quiz creator (instructor) can delete their quiz
- ✅ Requires authentication
- ✅ Returns 403 Forbidden if another user tries to delete
- ✅ Automatically deletes all quiz submissions when quiz is deleted

**API Endpoint:**
```
DELETE /api/instructor/quiz/:courseId
```

**Authorization:**
- User must be authenticated
- User must be the original creator of the quiz (instructorId match)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Quiz and all related submissions deleted successfully"
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- `401 Unauthorized` - User not authenticated
- `403 Forbidden` - User is not the quiz creator
- `404 Not Found` - Quiz doesn't exist
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Server error

## How to Use

### Delete a Quiz (Frontend)
```javascript
const deleteQuiz = async (courseId) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/instructor/quiz/${courseId}`, {
      method: 'DELETE',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    });
    
    const data = await response.json();
    
    if (data.success) {
      console.log('Quiz deleted successfully');
    } else {
      console.error(data.message);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error deleting quiz:', error);
  }
};
```

## Testing

1. **Test Delete as Quiz Creator:**
   - Create a quiz as an instructor
   - Delete the quiz using the DELETE endpoint
   - Should return success

2. **Test Delete as Different User:**
   - Try to delete another instructor's quiz
   - Should return 403 Forbidden

3. **Test 404 Warning Fix:**
   - Access a non-existent route (e.g., `/auth`)
   - Should NOT see security warning in console
   - Only 500+ errors should trigger warnings

## Database Impact

When a quiz is deleted:
1. The quiz document is removed from the `quizzes` collection
2. All related submissions are removed from the `quizsubmissions` collection

This ensures no orphaned data remains in the database.
